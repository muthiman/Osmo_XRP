## Proposal: Add `XRP.int3` to Alloyed XRP

### Overview

This proposal seeks to add **`XRP.int3`**â€”XRP bridged from XRP to Osmosis via the Bitfrost Bridge as a new constituent of **Alloyed XRP**. The proposal includes setting an **initial static cap of x%** to limit exposure while adoption matures.

### Background: Alloyed XRP

**Alloyed XRP** is already established as the canonical XRP representation on Osmosis. It currently has a circulating supply of approximately **\$17k** on Osmosis. The asset is composed of one bridged variant of XRP:

| Variant           | Origin                      | Suuply |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | --- |
| `XRP.core`        | Coreum                      | 100% |

---

### Proposed Addition

This proposal recommends including **`XRP.int3`** in the Alloyed XRP basket, allowing deposits via the Bitfrost bridge.

* **Initial Cap**: x%
* **Initial Exposure**: \~\$200,000
* **Rationale**: The cap is set conservatively to mitigate risk associated with the deployment of a new bridging product. This limit can be adjusted via governance as the bridge gains usage and demonstrates stability.
